# Data Structures & Algorithms using JavaScript/C++/Java

This repository contains computer programs related to data structures and algorithms written JavaScript/Node.js/C++.
Please hit star button on top to make it more accessible. Go Ahead.

## Installation

### Nodejs

1. Just Install Node.js in your computer. [Click Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node.js.
2. Clone/download folder. Open terminal and move into cloned folder.

```bash
cd data_structures
node file_name.js #to run any file in the folder.
```

### Java and C++

In case of Java check if JDK is installed on your machine.

```
java --version
```

If not, install.

Also Check g++ compiler is installed on your machine or not. It's inbuilt in linux/mac machines.

- Principles of recursion
  1. always check if the input is null or not

  2. or asks multiple questions at a time. If result of first question is true, it stops asking question and returns true. otherwise it 

  3. if asks question over some conditions. If those conditions are false. Then following questions are asked in else.

  4. always change atleast one argument while recurring. It must be changed to be closer to termination. The changing argument must be tested in termination condition.

  5.	recursin on		base case
	    array			size
      string			string length
      number			num == 0 or num == 1
      tree			root == null, root.left == null, root.right == null
    
  6. simplify only after function is correct
  7. Recur on the subparts that are of the same nature:
	  â€¢ On the sublists of a list.
	  â€¢ On the substrings of string
    
  8. Abstract common pattern with new function

## About This Repository

1. JavaScript programs are written for personal understanding of language. I do not recommend anyone to write data structures in JavaScript.
2. I mostly write algorithms in Java. I am currently updating Java codes. 

## Recent Updates

I am accepting PRs with clean & commented code.

## Happy Coding ðŸ˜Š
