# Data Structures & Algorithms using JavaScript/C++/Java

This repository contains computer programs related to data structures and algorithms written JavaScript/Node.js/C++.
Please hit star button on top to make it more accessible. Go Ahead.

## Installation

### Nodejs

1. Just Install Node.js in your computer. [Click Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node.js.
2. Clone/download folder. Open terminal and move into cloned folder.

```bash
cd data_structures
node file_name.js #to run any file in the folder.
```

### Java and C++

In case of Java check if JDK is installed on your machine.

```
java --version
```

If not, install.

Also Check g++ compiler is installed on your machine or not. It's inbuilt in linux/mac machines.

## Syllabus to be completed in DS&ALGO

### Introduction

- [x] model of computers
- [x] main memory structure - heap memory vs stack memory
- [x] physical data structures - Arrays - Linked Lists
- [x] logical data structures - stacks (linear) - queues (linear) - trees (non-linear) - graphs (non-linear) - hash tables (tabular)
- [x] asysmptotic notations - Big O - Big omega - Big theta
- [x] difference between best case complexity and worst case complexity
- [x] Analysis of simple programs by time and space complexity

### data structures

- Heap
  - [x] inserting element into heap
  - [x] deleting element from heap
  - [x] creation of heap
  - [x] traditional creation + deletion -> heapsort
  - [x] heapify + deletion -> heapsort

### MySQL

## About This Repository

The JavaScript is very light weight, high level, general purpose programming language. It is multi paradigm language, that is, we can use JavaScript in functional, procedural and/or Object Oriented way.

Though it is not recommended to write data structures programs using JavaScript, I have written these programs for my personal understanding and deeper clarity about 1) Programming in Js 2) Developing data structures.

## Recent Updates

I'm busy in working on my own startup. So not able to update the DS&ALGO codes till November 2020.

## Happy Coding 😊
