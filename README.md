# Data Structures & Algorithms using JavaScript/C++/Java

This repository contains computer programs related to data structures and algorithms written JavaScript/Node.js/C++.
Please hit star button on top to make it more accessible. Go Ahead.

## Installation

### Nodejs

1. Just Install Node.js in your computer. [Click Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install Node.js.
2. Clone/download folder. Open terminal and move into cloned folder.

```bash
cd data_structures
node file_name.js #to run any file in the folder.
```

### Java and C++

In case of Java check if JDK is installed on your machine.

```
java --version
```

If not, install.

Also Check g++ compiler is installed on your machine or not. It's inbuilt in linux/mac machines.

## Syllabus to be completed in DS&ALGO

### Introduction

- [x] model of computers
- [x] main memory structure - heap memory vs stack memory
- [x] physical data structures - Arrays - Linked Lists
- [x] logical data structures - stacks (linear) - queues (linear) - trees (non-linear) - graphs (non-linear) - hash tables (tabular)

### data structures

- heap

  - [x] inserting element into heap

## About This Repository

1. JavaScript programs are written for personal understanding of language. I do not recommend anyone to write data structures in JavaScript.
2. I mostly write algorithms in Java. I am currently updating Java codes. 

## Recent Updates

This is not an active project, at least for now :|
